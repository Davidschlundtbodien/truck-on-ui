    content: "Decided to give Red Cone Pass one last run before the end of the season. There is a large rock obstacle below tree line which may be hard for unmodified trucks, but I made it up in my stock 4runner with careful lines. Very snowy and icy at the top with gusts of wind about 70mph! Not advisable to complete the trail at this time, turn back at the summit."
